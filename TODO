SERVER:
    -- 1. OVER <number of players>
    -- 2. Leaderboard sending
    -- 3. When client tries the same letter twice or more, the server notes fail and sends BAD each time
    -- 4. Change sprintf to string
    -- 5. Poll loop takes 100% processor time; set time to wait
    6. sendMsg() needs check, if client is still connected
* technical:
    -- - Check all mutex occurences and decide, whether somewhere is/isn't necessary
    - Split code into more functions
    -- - Change each sprintf to string (sendMsg has string argument anyway)

CLIENT:
